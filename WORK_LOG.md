| January 6  |  1:15-1:45  |                  I spent thie time considering the optimal solution to this problem. I think I landed on using depth first search to find every possible path to find words (allows for duplicates when taken along difference paths) and using |

| January 10 | 9:10-10:10  | I spent this time implementing the code as I outlined it in my comments. The code is very close to working, but there are ways in which I can speed it up. I need some way of preening branches off of the tree once they are no longer needed. |
